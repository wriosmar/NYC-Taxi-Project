    "The goal of this project is to predict the trip duration of any given taxi ride. We will be taking into consideration various data points including: distance, pickup & drop-off location, month & time of day, and number of passangers. This is useful to both users and taxi companies to know and understand the different factors in how long a taxi ride will take. \n",
